# Faketorio

Want to play co-op with your friends but don't want to rent servers?

Here is a small (dumb) python script which acts like a fake server. All it does it pushes and pulls from a remote git repository. 

Basically, you host, play together with your friend, save your world, your friend will automatically find it on their computer. 

You can use this an .exe , and run it as a background process. Meaning, it will keep running in the background without you knowing.
